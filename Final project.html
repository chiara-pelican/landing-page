    <h2>What are seasonal fruit and veggies and why should you eat them?</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <p class="text">
        Seasonal fruit and veggies are purchased and consumed during the same
        time of the year they are harvested.
      </p>
      <ul class="reasons">
        <li>
          <h4 class="per-reason">Healthier</h4>
          <p class="text">
            Seasonal food is <em>fresh, tasty, and has more nutrients</em> than
            the ones out of season. The perfect growing conditions warrant the
            maximal quality freshness of the product and the best taste.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4 class="per-reason">Funnier</h4>
          <p class="text">
            Instead of eating the same 3/5 fruit and vegetables all year round,
            just break the routine! You can eat every month a different seasonal
            fruit/veggie and experiment with new recipes and tastes
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4 class="per-reason">Local and cheaper</h4>
          <p class="text">
            Since easier to produce in their peak season, the prices are also
            lower. Purchase them from your local farmer: they can save on
            packaging and distribution costs and you can enjoy cheap and best
            quality fruit and veggies!
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4 class="per-reason">Healthy for the Earth!</h4>
          <p class="text">
            Production of non-seasonal food generally demands a huge amount of
            water, energy, and chemical additives. Sticking to the natural earth
            seasonal harvesting routine will create a suistainable eating
            pattern.

          <p class="text">
            In the summer, you can start your day with a charge of berries'
            (blackberries, blueberries, raspberries) vitamines in your muesli
            bowl. Have a snack with juicy and sweet peaches or plums and enjoy
            your warm summer evenings with a cold and fresh slice of watermelon.
            Summer is also the time of tasty tomatoes and cucumbers: just add
            olives, feta, and olive oil for a perfect Greek salad! Do you prefer
            carbs? No problem! Zucchini will be amazing in your pasta or
            risotto.
